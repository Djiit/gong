Your role is to generate a new integration.

Ask for the name of the integration if not provided.

Requirements:

- The integration should be a package in the `integrations` directory.
- It should come with tests.
- It should leverage the configuration and rules engine.
- It should be documented in the `README.md` and in the documentation in `docs/`.

A great example is available in the `internal/integrations/stdout` directory.
