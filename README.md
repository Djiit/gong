## About

üõéÔ∏è gong is a tiny, work-in-progress, opinionated CLI for nudging/pinging reviewers on GitHub pull requests.

## Installation

gong can be installed in several ways:

### Using Homebrew (preferred)

```bash
brew install Djiit/homebrew-gong/gong
```

### As a GitHub CLI extension

```bash
gh extension install Djiit/gh-gong
```

### Using Go

```bash

```

### Using Docker

```bash

```

You can then run gong using:

```

## Features

Ping reviewers on GitHub pull requests on different platforms (github comment, slack message, etc.)

### Integrations

#### GitHub Actions Integration

When used within GitHub Actions workflows, gong can output its results to GitHub Actions environment variables and workflow outputs for further processing. This integration writes to:

- `GITHUB_OUTPUT`: Sets outputs for use in subsequent workflow steps
  - `active_reviewers`: Comma-separated list of reviewers to ping
  - `active_reviewers_count`: Number of reviewers to ping
  - `has_active_reviewers`: Boolean indicating if there are reviewers to ping
  - `disabled_reviewers`: Multiline list of reviewers that won't be pinged with status details

- `GITHUB_ENV`: Sets environment variables for use in subsequent workflow steps
  - `GONG_ACTIVE_REVIEWERS`: Comma-separated list of reviewers to ping
  - `GONG_ACTIVE_REVIEWERS_COUNT`: Number of reviewers to ping
  - `GONG_HAS_ACTIVE_REVIEWERS`: Boolean indicating if there are reviewers to ping

Example workflow usage:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run gong
    id: gong
    run: gong ping --repo ${{ github.repository }} --pr ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --integration actions

  - name: Use gong outputs
    if: steps.gong.outputs.has_active_reviewers == 'true'
    run: |
      echo "Pinging reviewers: ${{ steps.gong.outputs.active_reviewers }}"
      echo "Total reviewers to ping: ${{ steps.gong.outputs.active_reviewers_count }}"
```

### Rules-Based Delay System

gong allows you to configure custom delays based on reviewer names using glob patterns. This lets you define different waiting periods before pinging different reviewers or teams.

#### Configuration Example

In your config file, you can specify a global delay and override it with specific rules:

```yaml
# Global settings
enabled: true # Enable or disable pinging functionality globally
delay: 0 # Global delay (in seconds) before pinging reviewers

# Rules for custom delays based on reviewer name patterns
rules:
  - matchName: "@org/*"
    delay: 86400 # 24 hours delay for organization members
    enabled: true # Enable or disable this specific rule (defaults to true if not specified)
  - matchName: "external-*"
    delay: 172800 # 48 hours delay for external reviewers
    enabled: true
  - matchName: "urgent-team"
    delay: 0 # No delay for urgent team
  - matchName: "do-not-ping-*"
    delay: 0
    enabled: false # Disable pinging for reviewers matching this pattern
```

Rules are evaluated in order, and the first matching rule's delay is applied. If no rules match a reviewer, the global delay is used. Setting a delay to 0 means reviewers will be pinged immediately.

The `enabled` setting can be specified:

- At the global level to enable/disable all pinging functionality
- At the rule level to enable/disable specific rules

By default, `enabled` is set to `true` if not specified.
